  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
  <p>Data cleaning is a crucial step in the data analysis process, as it involves identifying and correcting or removing errors, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies in datasets. This repository focuses on demonstrating various data cleaning techniques using Python and the Pandas library, providing students with practical examples they can learn from and apply to their own projects.</p>

  <h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
  <p>To use the code in this repository, you'll need to have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python Downloads</a></p>

  <p>The Pandas library is a dependency for this project. You can install it using pip, a package installer for Python. Open your command prompt or terminal and run the following command:</p>

  <pre><code>pip install pandas</code></pre>

  <h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
  <p>The repository contains Python scripts that demonstrate different data cleaning techniques. You can either clone the repository or download the individual scripts to use them in your own projects.</p>

  <p>To run a script, open your command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located. Then, execute the script using the Python interpreter. For example:</p>

  <pre><code>python data_cleaning_script.py</code></pre>

  <p>Feel free to explore the code and modify it to suit your specific requirements. Make sure to read the comments within the scripts, as they provide explanations and instructions for each step of the data cleaning process.</p>

  <h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
  <p>This repository provides the following examples of data cleaning techniques:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Handling missing values:</strong> This example demonstrates various strategies for dealing with missing values in datasets, such as imputation, removal, or interpolation.</li>
    <li><strong>Removing duplicates:</strong> This example shows how to identify and remove duplicate entries from a dataset, ensuring data integrity and accuracy.</li>
    <li><strong>Standardizing data:</strong> This example focuses on standardizing data by converting it to a consistent format, such as converting string representations of dates to the proper date format.</li>
    <li><strong>Correcting inconsistent data:</strong> This example illustrates techniques for identifying and correcting inconsistent or erroneous data entries, such as correcting typos or resolving conflicting information.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Each example comes with a detailed explanation of the techniques used and the rationale behind them. You can refer to the individual scripts for more information.</p>
